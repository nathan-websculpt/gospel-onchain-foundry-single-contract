# Low Issues

## L-1: Centralization Risk for trusted owners

Contracts have owners with privileged rights to perform admin tasks and need to be trusted to not perform malicious updates or drain funds.

<details><summary>4 Found Instances</summary>

	contract BookManager is Ownable {
	```

	```

- Found in src/BookManager.sol [Line: 184](src/BookManager.sol#L184)

	```solidity
		) external onlyOwner {
	```

</details>



## L-2: Solidity pragma should be specific, not wide

Consider using a specific version of Solidity in your contracts instead of a wide version. For example, instead of `pragma solidity ^0.8.0;`, use `pragma solidity 0.8.0;`

<details><summary>1 Found Instances</summary>


- Found in src/BookManager.sol [Line: 2](src/BookManager.sol#L2)

	```solidity
	pragma solidity >=0.8.0 <0.9.0;
	```

</details>



## L-3: Event is missing `indexed` fields

Index event fields make the field more quickly accessible to off-chain tools that parse events. However, note that each index field costs extra gas during emission, so it's not necessarily best to index the maximum allowed per event (three fields). Each event should use three indexed fields if there are three or more fields, and gas usage is not particularly of concern for the events in question. If there are fewer than three fields, all of the fields should be indexed.

		event Book(
	```

	```

- Found in src/BookManager.sol [Line: 62](src/BookManager.sol#L62)

	```solidity
		event Finalization(address indexed finalizedBy, bytes bookId);
	```

</details>



## L-4: PUSH0 is not supported by all chains

Solc compiler version 0.8.20 switches the default target EVM version to Shanghai, which means that the generated bytecode will include PUSH0 opcodes. Be sure to select the appropriate EVM version in case you intend to deploy on a chain other than mainnet like L2 chains that may not support PUSH0, otherwise deployment of your contracts will fail.

- Found in src/BookManager.sol [Line: 2](src/BookManager.sol#L2)

	```solidity
	pragma solidity >=0.8.0 <0.9.0;
	```

</details>



## L-5: Modifiers invoked only once can be shoe-horned into the function



<details><summary>1 Found Instances</summary>


- Found in src/BookManager.sol [Line: 64](src/BookManager.sol#L64)

	```solidity
		modifier notFinalized(uint256 bookIndex) {
	```

</details>



## L-6: Potentially unused `private` / `internal` state variables found.

State variable appears to be unused. No analysis has been performed to see if any inilne assembly references it. So if that's not the case, consider removing this unused variable.

<details><summary>1 Found Instances</summary>


- Found in src/BookManager.sol [Line: 18](src/BookManager.sol#L18)

	```solidity
		bool hasBeenFinalized;
	```

</details>



## L-7: Boolean equality is not required.

If `x` is a boolean, there is no need to do `if(x == true)` or `if(x == false)`. Just use `if(x)` and `if(!x)` respectively.

<details><summary>1 Found Instances</summary>


- Found in src/BookManager.sol [Line: 186](src/BookManager.sol#L186)

	```solidity
			require(thisBook.hasBeenFinalized == false, "This Book has already been finalized.");
	```

</details>



## L-8: Costly operations inside loops.

Invoking `SSTORE`operations in loops may lead to Out-of-gas errors. Use a local variable to hold the loop computation result.
